            My hobby is drawing.Drawing is a form of visual art in which an artist uses instruments to mark paper or other two-dimensional surface.Although not every artwork has been preceded by a drawing in the form of a preliminary sketch, drawing is in effect the basis of all visual arts.There are many digital art programs and devices. A drawing instrument releases a small amount of material onto a surface, leaving a visible mark. I like to do it when I am bored. It helps me to improve my drawing skills.
            I like sketchings and doodles drawing.It is something that we can do when we are bored , in free time and after school.It is fun to do drawing.It makes my pencil grip more stronger and tighter.It gives me more drawing ideas and technique.I would like to be an Artist when I grow up.</p>
